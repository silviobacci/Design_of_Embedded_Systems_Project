# Design_of_Embedded_Systems_Project
This project is simply the realization of a StopWatch running on a STM32F4 Discovery board. In particular the project aims to to see the difference in programming a board using an automatic generated code against programming it by hand.

## About 
This work has been realized in University of Pisa/Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in the context of Design of Embedded Systems exam.
